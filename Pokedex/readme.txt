I made this project following the SwiftBeta channel video. It is a Pokedex (Video game Pokemon saga creature list) that uses PokeAPI, SwiftUI, URLSession and JSONDecoder.

Once the video was finished, I continued (and will continue) to add more things to the App.

Things I have added:
A home screen with an animation when clicking on the central button (Pokeball image).

Things i will add:
Menu to select to show a list of pokemon from one number to another.
When a pokemon is selected, add a view to be able to see its data.
Basically, use more data from the PokeAPI.
